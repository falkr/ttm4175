:rat:Which labels are correct?

1. <span>(1)</span> state,         (2) final state,  (3) start state
2. <span>(1)</span> state,         (2) final state,  (3) initial state
3. <span>(1)</span> final state,   (2) state,        (3) start state
4. <span>(1)</span> state,         (2) initial state,(3) end state


## Question 2

:rat:Having a trigger on an initial transition...

1. ...is necessary, otherwise the transition is not triggered.
2. ...is optional for initial transitions.
3. ...is wrong because it can cause ambiguities.
4. ...is wrong because it this transition is triggered by the start of the state machine.

:rat:Which of the state machines STM1, STM2, STM3 is equivalent to STM0?
This means they may look different, but have the same behavior.

1. STM3
2. None of them are equivalent.
3. STM1
4. STM2

:rat:What is problematic with this state machine?

1. It's unclear what happens when C is triggered in state s1.
2. State s2 is not reachable
3. State s1 is in a deadlock
4. C is will be triggered twice.

2. s0
3. s2
4. s1 and s2


## Question 7

:rat:Which of the following statements is wrong?

1. Executing a transitions takes no time.
2. A state machine is always in exactly one state.
3. Only one transition happens at any time.
4. Resting in a state takes no time.

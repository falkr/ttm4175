# Security 5


The last week of ethical hacking will consist of two topics. 
On Monday we will talk about password security by cracking password hashes. 
The aim is to understand how the passwords are stored and what the attacker can do with it. 
Please read this tutorial about it:

[Hashing Passwords: One-Way Road to Security](https://auth0.com/blog/hashing-passwords-one-way-road-to-security/)


On Thursday we discuss social engineering. 
Social engineering is the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information. 
Please read this article about it: 

[What is Social Engineering? Examples & Prevention Tips](https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-social-engineering)

As we already discussed, on the Thursday lab the task will be to send me a social engineering email and obtain my Gmail password (only the Gmail, not NTNU :) ). 
You can already think about a good story.

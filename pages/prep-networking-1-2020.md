# IP Addresses, Subnets and Routing

Last week you have already learned about IP addresses and how to connect your Raspberry Pi to the Internet.
Now you will learn even more about IP addressing, routing and the fundamental aspects that enable the Internet.

To know more about networking we will be using the book [An Introduction To Computer Networks](http://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/), which can be freely downloaded.
We will be using this book in the upcoming three weeks.

Reading the *first chapter is recommended* but not mandatory.
However, each week will focus on specific sections that need to be read and understood.
*Details about the required readings will be available in each section, **in bold**.*

## Learning Goals

:goals: After this week you will be able to:

- Understand IP addresses and their organisation into subnets
- Create and configure Local Area Networks (LANs)
- Use basic Linux commands for managing:
    - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
    - routes and routing tables


# Understanding IP addresses and subnets

The following video gives a short overview how IP addresses are used on our everyday lives whenever we use the Internet.

## More about IP addresses

Focusing on IP addresses, and to prepare for the lecture's quiz, you need to read **section 1.10 (from page 24 to page 29)**.
If you already read the first chapter you can skip to the next section on subnets.

## Subnets

In order to better understand subnets, which we will use together with private addresses, you should read **section 7.3 (page 190)**.
After knowing more about special addresses you need to understand how subnets are used in IPv4 and IPv6 by reading:

- **Section 7.6 and 7.6.1 (from page 194 to 198)** -- IPv4
- **Section 8.10 and 8.10.1 (pages 248 and 249)** -- IPv6


# Routing

The videos and readings above already provided some insights about routing.
However the following video provides more information and shows the importance of routing in today's Internet.

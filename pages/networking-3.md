# Networking in Linux -- Wi-Fi and NAT

The overall goal of this lab\. is to combine the previously acquired networking knowledge on networking with wireless communications and some more sophisticated address management.
This will be achieved using available tools and software in Linux to manage a small network.


:goals: After this lab you will be able to:

- Understand how basic Wi-Fi works
- Understand how IP Masquerading works
- Use Linux commands and software for:
    - creating a Wi-Fi access point
    - enabling IP Masquerading and NAT


# Lab\. Exercises

Please **read each exercise** entirely before starting to solve it.

Remember you should deliver a report after the networking module is finished.
It should include the main commands and configurations necessary to complete each exercise.
Do not forget to take notes while solving the exercises so you do not have to repeat them.

These exercises should be completed in teams.

This exercise builds on the work that has been done in the previous weeks.
Your _router_ rPi should already have all the necessary software but if you have skipped any steps in the previous labs\. make sure nothing is missing.

The **final goal** of this exercise is to create a simple wireless router using only open-source software in your Raspberry Pi (rPi).
To reach this goal we will connect the _router_ rPi to the Internet using the Ethernet card and use Wi-Fi to connect the _client_.
As seen in the figure, in the end, you should be able to wirelessly connect multiple devices to your _router_ and they should automatically get all the required network configurations to access the Internet.


## Software Checklist

The _router_ must have the following packages installed:

- _tcpdump_
- _isc-dhcp-server_
- _hostapd_
- _apache2_ or _nginx_ (for the additional exercise only!)

The _client_ does not require any specific software.


## Configuring a wireless router

:steps:
1. Configure a static IP address for the network interface `wlan0`.
2. Configure the _hostapd_ software previously installed in order to create a Linux Wi-Fi access point.
3. *start*, and optionally *enable*, the *hostapd.service* 
4. Activate DHCP on the interface `wlan0` on the *isc-dhcp-server* configuration file (and remove `eth0`).
5. Re-configure the DHCP server properties in the *dhcpd.conf* file without forgetting:


- to declare this DHCP server as authoritative;
- to specify a subnet and range matching the IP/mask of `wlan0`;
- to provide the required DNS information;
- to specify the *router* as the default router;
- to assign a fixed IP address to the _client_.

:steps:
6. *start*, and optionally *enable*, the *isc-dhcp-server.service* 

<button class="w3collapsible">Hint (interfaces)</button>
<div class="w3content">
The interface `wlan0` may not show an IP address until it is "UP", which means until it is being used.
In particular, it `wlan0` may only be seen as up after starting _hostapd_

Make sure that the `wlan0` interface is _unblocked_, you can check it with the command `rfkill` and that it is not connected to any wireless network.

Note also that changes in configuration files are not automatically applied. Typically you can simply restart the service in question (e.g. the _dhcpcd.service_ or the _networking.service_), however a reboot is sometimes easier.
</div>

<button class="w3collapsible">Hint (hostapd)</button>
<div class="w3content">
An example on how to configure an access point with _hostapd_ can be found in the file _hostapd.conf_ or  _hostapd.conf.gz_, the latter can be extracted with the command `gunzip`.
This includes many options, from which *ssid and wpa_passphrase* should obviously be edited, but also other less trivial options that should look like this:

      driver=nl80211
      country_code=NO
      auth_algs=1
      wpa=2
      rsn_pairwise=CCMP 

Before the _start_/_enable_ of the _hostapd_ service do not forget to point to its configuration file by editing the service's default options located at "/etc/default/".

If the _hostapd_ service is reported as masked you can use `systemctl unmask hostapd` to unmask it.
</div>

<button class="w3collapsible">Hint (dhcpd)</button>
<div class="w3content">
Remember that the _isc-dhcp-server.service_ **will not start** if the chosen interface is not up or if it does not share a common subnet space with the specified configurations.
</div>

## Configuring the _client_

:steps:
1. Update the configuration of the *dhcpcd.conf* file from the *client* so that it connects to the created wireless network.
For this you need to make sure that the interface `wlan0` is not using any static configuration, so that it uses DHCP and *wpa_supplicant* (default) to automatically connect to the wireless network.
2. Restart the _dhcpcd_ service with `systemctl` and verify that the `wlan0` interface has the static IP address you have specified.
3. Confirm that you have wireless connectivity between both Pis and disconnect the Ethernet cable if successful.
4. Try to connect to the network with your phone or laptop.

<button class="w3collapsible">Hint (DHCP)</button>
<div class="w3content">
Remember that if you Ethernet interface has been configured with a static IP address, it will not use DHCP, unless you used a "fallback configuration".
Consider reviewing the *dhcpcd.conf* file on your client.
</div>

<button class="w3collapsible">Hint (wpa\_supplicant)</button>
<div class="w3content">
The required configuration of a wireless interface to automatically connect to a network can be done by editing the *wpa\_supplicant.conf*.
This file should have a network entry looking like this:

      network={
           ssid="networkname"
           psk="networkpassword"
      }
</div>


## Enable routing

Even though your _client_/phone/laptop can connect to the wireless network you created, Internet connectivity will still not be available.
For this we need to use IP Masquerading.

:steps:
1. Connect your _router_ to the Internet using the available Ethernet interface, if you have not done it yet, and test for connectivity.
2. Enable IP forwarding in the *router* and activate IP Masquerading with the following commands:
```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -d 255.255.255.255/32 -i eth0 -o wlan0 -j DROP
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -d 255.255.255.255/32 -i wlan0 -o eth0 -j DROP
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wlan0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
```

:steps:
3. Verify that the _client_ is now able to connect to any Internet server.

<button class="w3collapsible">Hint</button>
<div class="w3content">
IP forwarding is necessary for a Linux machine to act as a router and forward packets from one interface to another.
You can debug/monitor your interfaces using `tcpdump`.

IP Masquerading is commonly referred to as NAT (Network Address Translation) but is slightly different because it is mainly used to hide private IP addresses and not remapping IP address spaces.
</div>



# Additional Exercise

In the previous exercise you have enabled routing between several wireless-capable nodes and even used _iptables_ for enabling IP Masquerading.
However, we may not always want to allow access to all the nodes in our network and using _iptables_ is a great way to achieve this.
This exercise is **optional** and can be accomplished in several different ways.

## Hardened Pi Router

The goal of this exercise is to:

:steps:
1. Block all traffic coming for the range of IPs given by your DHCP server (i.e. only manually configured or fixed IP addresses can access the Internet).
2. Instead of blocking the traffic, redirect it to a pre-defined "funny" server such as <http://folk.ntnu.no/davidfp/security>.
3. In addition to redirecting traffic, modify the URL of an HTTP request to another destination.

<button class="w3collapsible">Hints</button>
<div class="w3content">
You only need to edit the configurations of your _router_.

To redirect traffic you can use _iptables_ DNAT to change the destination of traffic to a predefined server address.

To modify URLs you can combine DNAT with a locally running webserver such as _nginx_ hosting rules for manipulating HTTP headers.

## Validation

Ask your double team to test their setup and let them test yours.

Think and write about the weaknesses of the used approach to a firewall.

**Try to beat it!**

# Final Steps

### Learning Goals

In your double-team, reflect about what you learned today. Write a few sentences that capture (in your own words) what you learned and why it can be useful. Share these few sentences with everyone in the double-team. (You should use this text in the individual reflection below.)

:aside: <img src="figures/doubleteam.png" width="30"/>


### Individual Reflection

Fill out the <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=cgahCS-CZ0SluluzdZZ8BSxiepoCd7lKk70IThBWqdJUQzJJUEVaQlBBMlFaSFBaTllITkcxRDEzNi4u" class="arrow">individual reflection survey</a>.


### The Combination Lock

Each team gets their own combination lock so you can store the box in the lockers in the lab. 

* The locks come opened and with the opening combination set.
* Take a picture of that combination in your phone, so you remember it.
* Do not attempt to change the code. (You do so by turning the locks opening 180 degrees and then setting them --- don't do that by accident.) 


### Cleaning Up

:todo:
- Put all hardware back into the box.
- Store the box in one of the lockers in the lab, using the combination lock.
- Connect all parts of the PC back to it (keyboard, mouse, monitor).
- Take out any trash. (Even if its not yours... thank you!)
- Put the chairs back to the table.

### Individual Exercises

We recommend that you take some time to consider if there are any parts of this unit that you want to repeat individually, at your own pace. If you decide to do so, you have several options:

- You have access to the hardware box at all times from the lockers. Just make sure everyone in your team knows where the box is, and put it back into the locker.
- Install a Raspberry Pi Image on a Virtual Box in your PC. With this, you always have a Raspberry Pi with you.
- Some of the Linux-related exercises also work on the Linux-PCs in the lab.

## Question 1

:rat:Q: In IP addresses, when we consider an octet (8 bits) what is the highest number we can represent?

1. 255
2. 256
3. 255.255.255.255
4. 256.256.256.256

## Question 2

:rat:Q: IP addresses are used:

1. only on the Intranet behind NAT.
2. in routing tables for determining the path a packet takes.
3. only on the Internet.
4. only by hosts such as computers and other IoT devices.

## Question 3

:rat:Q: In decimal notation, the IP address 00001001 00001001 00001001 00001001 is:

1. 9.9.9.9
2. 8.8.8.8
3. 7.7.7.7
4. 17.17.17.17

## Question 4

:rat:Q: If we need to give an address 32 machines, what is the minimum number of bits would we need?

1. 16 bits
2. 5 bits
3. 6 bits
4. none of the other options is correct.

## Question 5

:rat:Q: If we need to give an address to 48 machines, what is the minimum number of bits would we need?

1. 5 bits
2. none of the other options is correct.
3. 16 bits
4. 6 bits

## Question 6

:rat:Q: What is the main difference between IPv4 and IPv6?

1. IPv4 addresses have 128 bits instead of 32 bits
2. IPv6 addresses have 256 bits instead of 32 bits
3. IPv4 addresses have 256 bits instead of 32 bits
4. IPv6 addresses have 128 bits instead of 32 bits

## Question 7

:rat:Q: A protocol:

1. defines the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event, but not the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities.
2. defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.
3. defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, but not the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.
4. defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken based only on timer events.

## Question 8

:rat:Q: Following the book's definition, what is the difference between a host and an end-system?

1. There is no difference.
2. A host is typically a PC or Laptop.
3. A host is typically a client.
4. An end-system is typically a Server.

## Question 9

:rat:Q: In the upcoming networking labs we will use:

1. the VM based on a Raspbian image I've already used earlier.
2. NTNU's computers with everything already installed.
3. an additional VM based on an Ubuntu image I've already downloaded.
4. an additional VM based on a Raspbian image I've already cloned.

## Question 10

:rat:Q: Why are networking protocols important?

1. They are important to guarantee the same level of quality between applications.
2. They are important to prevent illegal Internet activities.
3. They are important to guarantee the same level of quality between users.
4. They are important to guarantee that systems can interoperate correctly.

# MQTT

This week, you will learn how to communicate by using a protocol that is
called **MQTT**. Like HTTP, it is usually executed on top of TCP/IP, but
you will notice that this protocol is **very different from HTTP**, in many
respects. That's one of the reasons why we look at it. Once you have
understood HTTP and MQTT, you have covered a lot of mechanisms,
properties, patterns and architectures that are used in communication
protocols.



## Learning Goals

:goals: After this week, you will be able to:

- Create an MQTT client in Python.
- Publish and receive messages, including data payload.
- Select proper quality-of-service levels.
- Design MQTT topics for applications.

# Working in Teams

You have already started to work in a team, and maybe got to know some of the team members a little bit better.
Much of the work as an engineer is done in teams.
Working well in teams, and coordinating them is maybe one of the most important non-technical skills you need when working.

We therefore spend an entire week only on learning about teamwork and reflecting about it. 



## Learning Goals

:goals: After this week, you will be able to:

- Be more aware of the importance of teamwork
- Be aware and reflect about your own role in teams



# Preparation


## Teamwork in this Course

As an introduction, [read this short introduction about teamwork in this specific course](working-in-teams.html).


## Team Roles

Everyone is different, and has different points of view, different strengths, preferences and weaknesses.
Working as an effective team also means to be aware of these differences, being aware of each others' strengths, weaknesses and compensate where necessary.
As a start, we perform a role analysis for each one of you. For this, we use the team roles by Belbin. (There are different models, but we found these to fit nicely in our setting.)


### Video on Team Roles

First, have a look at the following lecture that explains the different roles:

[Panopto Lecture on Team Roles](https://ntnu.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c3d62bf1-5f41-4c18-be55-aefd00950bc3) (40 min, requires NTNU Login)


### Testing Your Team Roles

You should receive an email from Belbin (admin@belbin.com) with a personal link for a test of your team roles. When you are asked for your email address, it is important that you use the one from NTNU. (See Blackboard for a list of all student email adresses we have registered.) Contact me in case you did not receive an email from Belbin.

During the teamwork afterwards we discuss each others profiles in teams, and it makes most sense to handle the results openly. This should not be a concern as the profile you receive does not judge you, but lists potential preferences and weaknesses in a weighted way, so you don't need to be concerned that results are somehow interpreted negative. (I did the test myself and will show you my own profile in class.)
For this test to be useful, you should fill it out as correctly as possible, otherwise you are not learning anything about yourself.
**The test is voluntary**, if you don't want to reveal this private information, don't do the test, it has no influence on you passing the course.

Print out the profile you receive as a result, especially the table on page 4 with your profile. This will be important input in the teamwork.

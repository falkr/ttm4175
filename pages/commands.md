# Useful Shortcuts

While you type commands and argumets, you can use some useful shortcuts. There are many, but here are some you should know:

* `Ctrl-C` This cancels whatever you currently write, and you get again an empty command line without executing any command.
* `Tab` Pressing the tab key tries to auto-complete the word you are currently writing. This may be for instance a command or a file name. If there are more than one option, nothing will be completed, but if you press tab twice, you will see a list of options.
* `Ctr-R` lets you search in the commands you executed before. Just press `Ctrl-R` and type a part of the command you remember, and you'll get an offer ot matches.

There are also shortcuts to move the curser:

* `Ctrl-a`  Move cursor to beginning of line
* `Ctrl-e`  Move cursor to end of line
* `Ctrl-b`  Move cursor back one word
* `Ctrl-f`  Move cursor forward one word
* `Ctrl-w`  Cut the last word
* `Ctrl-k`  Cut everything after the cursor
* `Ctrl-y`  Paste the last thing to be cut
* `Ctrl-_`  Undo  

These are just a few. You can find more by reading the pages for the shell, by typing `man bash`, or just searching on the internet.

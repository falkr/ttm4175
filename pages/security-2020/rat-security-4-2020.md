## Question 1

:rat:A hash function has to be collision-resistant. what does that mean?

1. It is computationally infeasible to find two inputs that hash to the same output
2. The output of the hash function is of fixed length
3. The hashing process is irreversible
4. The hashes are obtained within short time

## Question 2

:rat:Which measure(s) can help us prevent online attacks?

1. All answers are true
2. The usage of account lockouts by deactivating accounts after the detection of several failed login attempts
3. Two-factor authentication
4. Monitor server logs

## Question 3

:rat:What are rainbow tables?

1. Files that contain configuration parameters
2. Files that contain passwords and their pre-computed hashes
3. Files that contain a large number of passwords in plain text
4. Files that contain the usernames that are logged into the system

## Question 4

:rat:Why might offline brute force attacks be a bigger problem than the online ones?

1. The only limitation is the computing power available to the attacker
2. The attacker has an unlimited amount of time to crack the password
3. They are hard to detect, since there is no need to establish a connection to the targeted system
4. All answers are true

## Question 5

:rat:What is chntpw?

1. A program used to extract the content of the SAM file
2. A program used to crack passwords
3. A program used to clear a user's password from the "etc/shadow" file
4. A program used to clear a user's password from the SAM file

## Question 6

:rat:In addition to a good password policy, what other important measure(s) can make our systems more secure?

1. Nothing, a strong password is enough to ensure that the system is secure
2. Write down the passwords on a post-it note so we can have easy access to them when needed
3. Avoid risky behavior when storing passwords and be aware from social engineering
4. Store all passwords in a file in plain text in case we need to access them quickly

## Question 7

:rat:What is common for MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-2?

1. Algorithms used to reverse hashing
2. They are all hashing algorithms
3. They have nothing in common
4. Algorithms used for password cracking

## Question 8

:rat:In addition to its usage in password storage, what can hashing be used for?

1. None of the answers are correct
2. To store usernames and user info
3. To verify the integrity of a file after it has been transferred over insecure channels
4. To retrieve the plain text passwords from the hashes

## Question 9

:rat:What is SQL injection attack?

1. When a hacker tries to attack a database by executing malicious SQL statements
2. When a hacker tries to send a malicious URL by email
3. When a hacker tries to send a harmful HTML code
4. When a hacker sends multiple login attempts

## Question 10

:rat:What is Nmap used for?

1. To identify what devices are running on the system
2. For vulnerability scanning
3. For port scanning
4. All answers are true

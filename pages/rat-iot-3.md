## Question 1

:rat:Which of the following ways is a good idea to convert a data type (here a dictionary) stored in the variable \texttt{data} in Python into a string that can be easily stored or transmitted?

1. <code>string = str(data)</code>
2. <code>string = json.to_string(data)</code>
3. <code>string = json.load(data)</code>
4. <code>string = json.dumps(data)</code>

## Question 2

:rat:Imagine you want to send a message from one computer to another, but you want to ensure that this
message really reaches the other computer. What can you do?

1. Use the single-message pattern.
2. Add a timer to the single-message pattern.
3. Use a better transmission channel.
4. Use the request-response pattern.

## Question 3

:rat:What is the main difference between clients and servers?

1. The server runs in a data center, the client in a normal computer.
2. The server can send a message to the client whenever it wants, but not the other way round.
3. Only clients can start an interaction.
4. The server is a more powerful machine than a client.

## Question 4

:rat:Which of the following statements is true?

1. HTTP is only used to transfer HTML pages.
2. HTTP assumes a client-server interaction with request-response.
3. HTTP is a symmetric protocol, client and server can do the same things.
4. HTTP is integrated into (a part of) TCP/IP.

## Question 5

:rat:What means serialization, as understood in the preparation material?

1. To transform a data structure into a sequence of bits or bytes.
2. To execute a program in a sequence.
3. To transmit data via an electrical or optical signal.
4. To watch an entire season of a series in one weekend.

## Question 6

:rat:Which of the following is a valid serialization of data in JSON?

1. <code>&lt;data time="12:05", temperature="20.0", humidity="54.3"/&gt;</code>
2. <code>{"time": "12:05", "temperature": 20.0, "humidity": 54.3}</code>
3. <code>['time'='12:05', 'temperature'=20.0, 'humidity'=54.3]</code>
4. <code>&lt;data time="12:05" temperature="20.0" humidity="54.3"/&gt;</code>

## Question 7

:rat:Which type of diagrams can we use to show message exchanges?

1. sequence diagrams
2. serialization diagrams
3. message diagrams
4. synchronization diagrams

## Question 8

:rat:A request from a HTTP client arrives at a web server implemented in Python. What happens?

1. the server's method `respond()` is called
2. the server stores the request for later
3. the client invokes the `reply()` function
4. the server's method `do_GET()` is called.

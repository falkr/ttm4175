# Internet of Things

Most of you have heard about the Internet of Things. 
This is a technological trend which is caused by several developments:

- Embedded computing devices get smaller, cheaper and more energy-efficient. 
  This makes it feasible to embed computers into all kinds of devices. 
  
- Mobile coverage is improving, and new protocols are available that are suitable for energy-efficient machine-to-machine communication. 

- Advances in data analytics and machine learning make it possible to process data and learn from it, so that data gathered by many embedded devices can be transformed into valuable knowledge.


Apart from these enablers, there are also considerable challenges:

- **Security and privacy:** See below.
- **Environmental footprint:** More devices also means more waste. How can this probem be solved?
- **Energy-efficiency:** Despite improvements, powering IoT devices is still a problem and batteries are often not a good solution. 
- **Lack of integration:** There are many IoT products, but connecting devices from different vendors or product families is still difficult or impossible.

We start this part of the course by considering security and privacy, with a series of presentations and interviews.




## IoT Security, Safety, Privacy

The following are three videos that discuss security, safety and privacy within the IoT. Let's first have a look at security in general:

## Safety in IoT

<!-- 7:48 -->

This is a video from the Computerphile Channel. From the description: "A hacked car that could kill you should be more worrying than a thousand lightbulbs taking Facebook offline. University of Cambridge's Professor Ross Anderson explains why safety should be higher on the agenda than privacy." 

**This is the shortest of the videos. Though you should watch all, focus you attention on this one.**

## Privacy in IoT

<!-- 17:37  -->

The following is an interview with [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman), the founder of the Free Software Foundation. The interview starts a bit awkward, but gets into the fundamental privacy issues raised by IoT.

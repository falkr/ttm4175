# What are CTFs?

Capture the Flag (CTF) is a special kind of information security competitions. There are three common types of CTFs: Jeopardy, Attack-Defence and mixed.

Jeopardy-style CTFs has a couple of questions (tasks) in range of categories. For example, Web, Forensic, Crypto, Binary or something else. A team gets some points for every solved task. Generally teams will be awarded more points for more difficult tasks. The next task in the chain will be unlocked after you solve the previous one. The team with the most points when the time is over is the winner. A famous example of this kind of CTF is the DEFCON CTF Qualifier.

Attack-defence is another interesting kind of competition. Here every team has their own network, with many machines, or a single computer, with vulnarable services. The teams are given an amount of time to patch services and secure the network or system and developing exploits to hack the systems of other teams.  So, then organizers connects participants of competition and the wargame starts! You should protect own services for defence points and hack opponents for attack points. Historically this is a first type of CTFs, everybody knows about DEF CON CTF - something like a World Cup of all other competitions.

Today we are going to do a relatively short Jeopardy style CTF. The category is Linux, which means that the security aspect of the CTF is not really present. It is more of a way to become more familiar with the terminal and navigation around the linux file structure. 

## teknostart_ctf.py

The file `teknostart_ctf.py` is located in you home folder, which would be `/home/pi`. This is a progam written in the programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/), and is also a terminal based game.

The game consists of 10 levels that are supposed to make you feel a little more comfortable using the Terminal as a tool for the Linux Command Line. The first level is used as an example to show how the game is run.

#### Step 1/2:
On your Raspberry Pi:
Open the terminal and check that you are in the folder `/home/pi/`. If not, navigate to that folder.

:hint: type `pwd`to check which directory you are currently in
:hint: type `cd /home/pi` to change folder


#### Step 2/2: 
Check if the `teknostart_ctf.py`is in the folder.

:hint: use `ls`

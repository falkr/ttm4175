## Question 1

:rat:Which statement is not true regarding storing the password in cleartext in the database?

1. If the attacker manages to obtain the data in the database he/she has access to the passwords immediately
2. The length of the passwords does not strengthen the security
3. The administrator of the database can see everyone's password
4. It makes the webpage vulnerable

## Question 2

:rat:Which statement is not correct regarding hashing?

1. The hash is generated using rainbow tables
2. The length of the input does not influence the length of the hash
3. We cannot get back the cleartext from the hash with mathematical algorithm
4. It is also called as message digest

## Question 3

:rat:Which of the following is not a hash algorithm?

1. 3HES
2. MD5
3. SHA-1
4. SHA-256

## Question 4

:rat:Which logical definitation writes the best hashing?

1. Reversible and non-deterministic
2. Irreversible and deterministic
3. Irreversible and non-deterministic
4. Reversible and deterministic

## Question 5

:rat:What is a salt in hash generation?

1. a secret method that makes algorithms able to recreate the cleartext from the hash
2. A component that guarantees to avoid hash collision
3. A value to verify the correctness of the hash calculation
4. a random text that is added to the cleartext for the hash generation

## Question 6

:rat:Which of the followings is an example of hash collision?

1. two cleartext has the same salt value
2. the attacker brute-forces the hash and find a collision with a cleartext
3. two cleartexts result in the same hash value
4. a cleartext has multiple hash values with the same algorithm

## Question 7

:rat:Which of the followings is not social engineering?

1. Sending an email on behalf of someone to obtain information
2. Persuading someone to download and install a tool that contains all answers for the TTM4175 RAT questions
3. Claiming that you cannot login to blackboard and asking someone to try to login on your computer while a keylogger is running
4. Hacking blackboard and exposing all social information about people

## Question 8

:rat:Who or what is the target of social engineering?

1. system administrators
2. web sites with login pages
3. all services
4. all people

## Question 9

:rat:What is phishing?

1. downloading something from a peer-to-peer site (torrent phishing)
2. bypassing physical security (asking someone to open a protected door for us, because we carry e.g. a heavy fishing rod)
3. Masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into clicking on a malicious link
4. asking someone about his/her password while doing a relaxing activity like fishing or sun bathing

## Question 10

:rat:Which advice is not useful to avoid phishing?

1. Use strong passwords
2. Use spamfilter and check the email header if it looks suspicious
3. Never give your password in email even if a trusted person asks you
4. Beware of any download from untrested sources

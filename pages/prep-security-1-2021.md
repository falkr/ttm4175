# Ethical Hacking, Lab 1


## Preparation

The task for the first lab week is to collect technical information about the target.
Technical information are the domains and subdomains belong to the target, the IP addresses and ranges that also belong to the target including hosted services.
To understand IP addresses please read the following short tutorial:

[How Do IP Addresses Work?](https://www.howtogeek.com/341307/how-do-ip-addresses-work/)


IP addresses are organized in IP ranges that belong to special subnets. 
IP ranges can be different types and indicated with different notations such as CIDR.
A short description about IP ranges can be found here:

IP address can be connected to domain names with subdomains to be easier to remember.

# Install Software 

For many aspects of collaboration, we are going to use Microsoft Teams in this course. It has functions for chat as well as sharing and collaborating on files. 

* Visit the [site about Office 365](https://innsida.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Office+365) and install **Microsoft Teams** on your laptop.
* Install it on your mobile devices (Android or iOS), too.
* You will receive an invitation link to the team _TTM4115 (2018)_ later.

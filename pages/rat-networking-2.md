## Question 1

:rat:Q: A network protocol:

1. may belong to multiple network layers.
2. must be implemented in hardware.
3. belongs to a single network layer.
4. requires multiple network layers.

## Question 2

:rat:Q: One of the main advantages of network layering is:

1. there are no advantages in network layering.
2. the direct communication between all layers.
3. potential duplication of lower-layer functionality.
4. the modularity, which allows for easier updates.

## Question 3

:rat:Q: One of the main disadvantages of network layering is:

1. there are no disadvantages in network layering.
2. the direct communication between all layers.
3. potential duplication of lower-layer functionality.
4. the modularity, which allows for easier updates.

## Question 4

:rat:Q: A server:

1. runs a single service only (1 server, 1 service).
2. is responsible for sending requests to clients.
3. is a physical computer with specialised hardware.
4. may run several services (1 server, N services).

## Question 5

:rat:Q: A laptop:

1. cannot be used as a client nor as a server
2. can be used as a client and as a server.
3. can only be used as a client.
4. can only be used as a server.

## Question 6

:rat:Q: The Internet protocol stack consists of:

1. three protocols: IP, TCP and HTTP.
2. five layers: the physical, link, network, transport and application layers.
3. seven layers: the physical, link, network, transport, session, presentation and application layers.
4. two protocols: IP and HTTP.

## Question 7

:rat:Q: The HTTP protocol, which provides for Web document request and transfer, resides at:

1. session layer.
2. the application layer.
3. the network layer.
4. transport layer.

## Question 8

:rat:Q: The Domain Name System (DNS), resides at:

1. transport layer.
2. session layer.
3. the application layer.
4. the network layer.

## Question 9

:rat:Q: The IP protocol, which defines the fields in the datagram, resides at:

1. the network layer.
2. the application layer.
3. transport layer.
4. session layer.

## Question 10

:rat:Q: In addition to an IP address, a networked process is reached by specifying:

1. a TCP buffer.
2. a port number.
3. a domain name.
4. a socket.

This book is used worldwide in computer network courses and provides a very good introduction to the subject.

We will also use the book in TTM4200 in the Spring semester, and other courses later on too, so it is important you buy it as soon as possible.
We will focus on the 7th edition but if you get the newest edition that is great too!

## Question 1

:rat:Q: In your browser, when opening a web page from 'www.ntnu.no':

1. the browser sends a request to NTNU's web server using NTNU's IP address, a reply is eventually received, which includes the DNS name, and then the browser can retrieve the web page.
2. the browser sends a request to NTNU's DNS server, a reply is eventually received, which includes the DNS name and IP address, and then the browser can retrieve the web page.
3. a DNS client sends a request to a DNS server, a reply is eventually received, which includes the IP address for the hostname, and then the browser can open a connection to NTNU's web server.
4. a DNS server sends a request to a DNS client, a reply is eventually received, which includes the IP address for the hostname, and then the browser can open a connection to NTNU's web server.

## Question 2

:rat:Q: Considering the subnet address 10.12.4.32/28, which option is correct?

1. This subnet includes 16 IP addresses (14 hosts), from 10.12.4.32 to 10.12.4.47
2. This subnet includes 32 IP addresses (30 hosts), from 10.12.4.0 to 10.12.4.31
3. The mask of this subnet can be represented as 255.255.255.128
4. The mask of this subnet can be represented as 255.255.255.0

## Question 3

:rat:Q: A router is responsible for:

1. adding IP layer headers to the data
2. creating logical or physical subnets
3. dropping packets or forwarding them to an interface
4. running the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) protocol

## Question 4

:rat:Q: When routing, the selection of the appropriate routing-table entry is based on:

1. the longest-prefix match for the destination
2. HELLO packets sent by the routing protocol
3. the shortest-prefix match for the destination
4. the Link State Routing protocol

## Question 5

:rat:Q: DNS is used for:

1. registering domains assigned by ICANN
2. looking up a name and retrieving an address
3. replacing IP addresses by names
4. supporting hierarchical networks

## Question 6

:rat:Q: DNS is:

1. distributed and hierarchical
2. flat and distributed
3. hierarchical and centralised
4. centralised and flat

## Question 7

:rat:Q: Imagine you have service running on a server with the domain name "ttm4175.no".
Because your service is so popular you decide to move it to another server but you cannot keep the same IP address.
How could you change between servers without having to ask your clients to do anything?

1. configure DHCP to start using the new server's IP address
2. add a new route in the old server to redirect all traffic sent to "ttm4174.no"
3. change the DNS record to start using the new server's IP address
4. use round-robin DNS for load balancing including the new server's IP address

## Question 8

:rat:Q: Consider the three classes of DNS server, ordered from top to bottom level, which option is correct?

1. Root DNS servers, Top-level domain servers and Authoritative DNS servers.
2. Top-level domain servers, Root DNS servers and Authoritative DNS servers.
3. Top-level domain servers, Authoritative DNS servers and Root DNS servers,
4. Root DNS servers, Authoritative DNS servers and Top-level domain servers.

## Question 9

:rat:Q: On a web server, a static HTTP server is responsible for processing and answering incoming requests in this order:

1. upon receiving a request, the server checks if the requested URL matches an existing file, if so, the web server sends the file content back to the browser. If not, the application server builds the necessary file.
2. upon receiving a request, the web server sends the file content back to the browser.
3. upon receiving a request, the server checks the corresponding IP address and if the requested URL matches an existing file.
4. upon receiving a request, the server checks if the requested URL matches an existing file, if so, the web server sends the file content back to the browser. If not, the web server returns an error message to the browser.

## Question 10

:rat:Q: The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):

1. can be static or dynamic.
2. is a textual and stateful protocol.
3. defines how web servers can make requests to clients.
4. is a textual and stateless protocol.

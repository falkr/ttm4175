# HTTP and JSON in Python

In this week, we will communicate via HTTP and build our own little
server for that. This server will be able to serve a simple website and
we will use it to store data from the Raspberry Pi.

## Learning Goals

:goals: After this week, you will be able to:

- Create your own webserver in Python.
- Serialize data in Python via JSON.
- Send complex data types via HTTP.
- Assemble an overall system.
- Know more about HTTP, JSON, client-server, request-response.

# Day 5: Recap

Today's objective is to not only review the main concepts and commands you have been using the whole week but also to get some deeper knowledge about them.

:goals: After this lab\. you will be able to remember and execute Linux commands for:

- Performing file operations
- Finding, viewing and editing files
- Managing user and group permissions
- Configuring networking interfaces
- Remotely accessing other machines
- Personalising the operating system

# Exercises

You will be given an exercise sheet where you should write your answers. These exercises should be solved by each team.

You must **deliver the exercise sheet** by the end of the Lab\., do not forget to **include your team number**.

For your convenience you may also access the exercises [here](https://www.iik.ntnu.no/ttm4175/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/exercises-linux_basics-woansV3.pdf).

# Final Steps

### Learning Goals

In your double-team, reflect about what you learned today. Write a few sentences that capture (in your own words) what you learned and why it can be useful. Share these few sentences with everyone in the double-team. (You should use this text in the individual reflection below.)

### Cleaning Up

:todo:
- Put all hardware back into the box.
- Store the box in one of the lockers in the lab, using the combination lock.
- Connect all parts of the PC back to it (keyboard, mouse, monitor).
- Take out any trash. (Even if its not yours... thank you!)
- Put the chairs back to the table.

### Individual Exercises

We recommend that you take some time to consider if there are any parts of this unit that you want to repeat individually, at your own pace. If you decide to do so, you have several options:

- You have access to the hardware box at all times from the lockers. Just make sure everyone in your team knows where the box is, and put it back into the locker.
- Install a Raspberry Pi Image on a Virtual Box in your PC. With this, you always have a Raspberry Pi with you.
- Some of the Linux-related exercises also work on the Linux-PCs in the lab.

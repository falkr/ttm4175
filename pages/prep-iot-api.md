# Application Programming Interfaces: APIs

This week we are going to construct an application that consists of
several components, some running on the Raspberry Pi, others running on
a server that we don't even have control over. In particular, we are
going to build an alarm application, which consists of a movement
sensor, a webcam, and the Sense HAT to display an alarm. In addition, we
want the alarm system to send a message via Slack, and also upload a
picture to it. For that, we need to use the Slack API, so that we can
integrate it into our application.

## Learning Goals

:goals: After this week, you will be able to:

- Read the documentation of an API and understand elements of it.
- Understand *some* of the mechanisms of APIs.
- Create simple applications from APIs.
- Understand some of the principles of REST API.


# APIs

Most software systems are not constructed completely new every time.
Instead, they consist of a set of reusable elements, also called
**components**. And even if a system is constructed completely from
scratch (without any reused code), it is much easier to construct it if
it is made up of individual components.

Components can be many things. One examples are Python modules, as you
have already used them. A Python module can encapsulate some
functionality that your program can use. We used for instance a Python
module that created a HTTP server, and another one to create an MQTT
client. Components can also be offered by the operating system, for
instance to read files or connect to the USB ports. Yet another example
are **distributed components**, running on a different machine. You can
for instance use Amazon's cloud storage to store files of your
application in a large data center.

*So, systems are made from components. But how can we ensure that they
work together properly?* This is where we use application programming
interfaces (APIs).

An API is a description and sometimes some additional code to ensure
that we use a software component correctly. Depending on how the
component is implemented an offers its API, i.e., in which language,
which underlying protocol and in which context, the description of APIs
vary a lot. The API describes how to invoke a function, what kind of
parameters to provide, and what to expect as a result. In Python, an API
is given as a set of functions, but there are many other possibilities
how an API can be built. A distributed API can be built from a set of
requests (HTTP requests, for instance), or remote functions. Some
programming languages or libraries offer support for **remote procedure
calls**. This is a technique for calling a method or function on another
computer as if the method was local, on the same computer.

Some APIs have only very few functions, while others may have thousands,
depending on the complexity of the component to connect to. The
following can be a complete API, for a very simple component that
periodically sends a temperature update:

```
TEMPERATURE API:
MQTT Broker: mqtt.example.com:1883
Subscribe to topic api/weather/temperature/json
Result will be messages in JSON, with format {"temp": 21}
```

## Examples for Web-based APIs

There are many APIs available on the internet. Here are just three
examples:

-   **Slack** This API is available at <https://api.slack.com> and
    allows to integrate applications with the Slack messaging service.
    Applications can send messages to users, or have chat-based dialogs
    with them.

-   **AtB Sanntid** Provides an API at
    [https://www.atb.no/sanntid/](https://www.atb.no/sanntid/#collapse-article_2)
    that shows the current position of busses and expected arrivals at
    buss stops.

-   **Meteorologisk institutt** provides a service with weather data and
    forecasts <https://api.met.no>.

**Task:** Browse through some of the links from the APIs above, and have
a look what they offer you to do, and how they describe what you should
do.

## APIs Provide Abstraction

APIs try to hide as much complexity of a problem as possible. With the
example of our very simple temperature API, we can use the API without
knowing how the details are implemented, for instance how the component
measures the temperature, or how it processes our request. To use it
properly, we are just interested in the behavior of the component as a
"black box." 
It is not always obvious which behavior we should hide or not --- maybe 
we are very much interested how the temperature was measured, but that depends on the entire system.

Abstraction also allows that a component changes over time how it
provides an API. It can for instance change details of the
implementation without that the user of the API needs to adapt anything.
(We come back to that later.)

## APIs Are Written With Use Cases in Mind

For an API to be useful, it should provide access to use cases that are
relevant for the programs that use it. This means how the individual
functions one can call are structured. For a math API, it seems to be a
good idea to have a method `add(a,Â b)` to add two numbers. A method
`add_two_(a)` which always adds the value two to a number is also
possible, but you may wonder if it is useful for an API. That depends of
course on the problem we build the API for. If the problem we want to
support needs to add the number two a lot, then we could think of
offering that as a dedicated method of the API.
(It' s a bit like organizing your stuff at home. Should you have an extra drawer for winter jackets? Or put all jackets together?). 
Therefore it requires some experience and some attempts to write a "good" API.

## APIs Evolve Over Time

We have said above that APIs evolve over time, and because of their way
of hiding features this can often happen without the other programs
noticing. However, that is not always the case. Sometimes the API itself
has to change more drastically, so that we can offer new functionality.
This is why APIs often have version numbers and evolve just like other
software. Sometimes updating to a new version of an API is simple, while
it sometimes may require a lot of changes.

## Ingredients for an API

What do we need when we want to build an API? Let's have a look at a
list of items we should think of before making an API:

-   A description of the use cases: We should know which purposes our
    API should serve. What do the users of our API want to do? Which
    kind of data do they have? What kind of result do they expect?

-   A library or framework or technology to offer the API. We need to
    understand how we want to offer our API. Is it a library that runs
    locally on a computer, for instance as Python module? Or is it a
    distributed API that we want to offer on a server?

-   A language for the API. How do we want to describe the API? When we
    use Python, we show the signatures of the functions, together with
    some documentation code. When it is a distributed API, we need some
    other technology. There also exist frameworks that generate nice web
    pages as documentation, for instance by parsing programming code and
    its documentation.

-   Examples. To get the use cases right, we often need a lot of
    examples for possible uses so we don't forget anything. Once a
    programmer is familiar with the technology behind an API, these
    examples can be the hardest thing to get, and understanding of them
    may evolve over time, which is why there can come a new version of
    an API.

# The Slack API

Slack is a messaging application that allows to integrate other
platforms to integrate via APIs. It is simple, for instance, to add
so-called *bots* to the service, which can add all kind of functions.
For instance, I often run some code on a server for experiments. With
only a few lines of code I can make this code to send a message via
Slack so that I am notified once the job is done. In the lab for this
unit we are going to build an alarm system with Slack.

:aside: If you like, have a look at the article [Slack Is Overrun With Bots.
Friendly, Wonderful Bots](https://www.wired.com/2015/08/slack-overrun-bots-friendly-wonderful-bots).


Slack does not only use a single API, but several ones:

-   The **Web API** offers access to channels and messages via HTTP
    resources. It works similar to our lab with HTTP. Client
    applications use HTTP requests, and Slack runs an HTTP server that
    accepts these requests. The content of the request is given as JSON,
    and can for instance send a message to a given channel. As usual in
    HTTP in this direction, all requests must originate from the client.
    Therefore, you cannot receive messages via this API, for example.

-   The **Events API** also uses HTTP and JSON, but in this API Slack is
    the client, and our application implements an HTTP server. For
    example, when a user sends a message on Slack, the Slack HTTP client
    makes a request to the HTTP server that our application runs and
    that we registered with Slack.

-   The **Real-Time Messaging API** uses Websockets as underlying
    technology. We haven't treated Websockets in the course, but this is
    some bi-directional alternative to HTTP, so that also the server can
    send messages to the client. Slack offers this API, but with some
    limitations.

This may be confusing at first, but when you know about the underlying
technologies, it makes more sense. In the lab, we are only going to use
the Web API, but this selection shows you how many possibilities there
are for APIs. And there are much more!

:aside: Have a look at the article [Which API is right for your Slack app?](https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/getting-started-with-slacks-apis-f930c73fc889).

# Wrapper Libraries

Assume that a service (such as Slack) offers an API via HTTP. You can
use this API in some "raw" form, and creating the right HTTP requests in
several ways:

-   You can use the command line program `curl` to create such requests.

-   You can use a browser, with some hacking, to make a corresponding
    request. (Not convenient, but often possible.)

-   More likely, you can program the request manually in Python, for
    instance using the `requests` library, as we did in the HTTP lab.

All of these methods are a bit cumbersome, aren't they? Therefore, there
is another option:

-   Someone may create an extra library in Python that encapsulates all
    the HTTP requests in Python with some code. The result can be an API
    in Python that uses internally HTTP to connect to a remote service
    like Slack.

The benefit of the client library (for instance in Python) is the
convenience. The client library can offer additional functions so that
the HTTP requests are encoded correctly, and data is handled
consistently. For a programmer, it almost appears as if Slack was
running locally on the computer, since all the HTTP requests are hidden
within the library.

:aside: Remember the *remote procedure calls* from above? These client
    libraries for web-based APIs achieve basically the same thing. Why
    technology has gone this way instead of using "real" remote
    procedure calls is hard to say, and there may not be a single
    reason. It can have to do with not depending on a specific
    programming language, or worries of scalability, for example.


# REST

Some APIs are called REST APIs, because they follow a certain
architectural style that makes it easier (or possible at all) that the
APIs are offered with some desirable properties. Such properties are for
instance performance and scalability, which are important once an API
has a lot of users at the same time. The idea is to use similar
mechanisms to enable such properties that also make HTTP work. And,
while REST is not constrained to HTTP, most APIs that adhere to the REST
principles are implemented in HTTP. Therefore, it is also okay to think
of REST as a set of rules how an API can be expressed using HTTP.

:aside: The following properties are copied form [this article](https://medium.com/extend/what-is-rest-a-simple-explanation-for-beginners-part-2-rest-constraints-129a4b69a582)


If you don't understand all of these constraints completely, or why they
are important, don't worry too much for now. REST is an architectural
style, which encapsulates a lot of experience. Some issues are not so
simple to grasp even for developers that have worked for some years.
Still---read through them. Many of these concepts and terms will come up
often.

-   **Client--server separation** *The client and the server act
    independently, each on its own, and the interaction between them is
    only in the form of requests, initiated by the client only, and
    responses, which the server send to the client only as a reaction to
    a request. The server just sits there waiting for requests from the
    client to come. The server doesn't start sending away information
    about the state of some resources on its own.*

-   **Stateless** *Stateless means the server does not remember anything
    about the user who uses the API. It doesn't remember if the user of
    the API already sent a GET request for the same resource in the
    past, it doesn't remember which resources the user of the API
    requested before, and so on. Each individual request contains all
    the information the server needs to perform the request and return a
    response, regardless of other requests made by the same API user.*

-   **Layered system** *Between the client who requests a representation
    of a resource's state, and the server who sends the response back,
    there might be a number of servers in the middle. These servers
    might provide a security layer, a caching layer, a load-balancing
    layer, or other functionality. Those layers should not affect the
    request or the response. The client is agnostic as to how many
    layers, if any, there are between the client and the actual server
    responding to the request.*

-   **Cacheable** *This means that the data the server sends contain
    information about whether or not the data is cacheable. If the data
    is cacheable, it might contain some sort of a version number. The
    version number is what makes caching possible: since the client
    knows which version of the data it already has (from a previous
    response), the client can avoid requesting the same data again and
    again. The client should also know if the current version of the
    data is expired, in which case the client will know it should send
    another request to the server to get the most updated data about the
    state of a resource.*

In other words, this makes an API behave much like an HTTP server
otherwise serving websites to many browsers.


# Orchestration vs.Â Choreography

Once we have a set of APIs we need to control how the overall system is
coordinated. For that, we distinguish two different patterns;
**orchestration** and **choreography**.

Let's start with an example from everyday life. Imagine you want to
organize a visit to the cinema with some friends, and you need to agree
on which movie to watch and when to meet and so on. There is two ways of
how to organize it:

-   You can yourself act as the orchestrator of the whole preparation,
    and call everyone (or Snap or whatever you do) and check with each
    and everyone of your friends what their preferences are, then come
    up with a plan that works for most of them and finally invite
    everyone.

-   You could also rely more on a distributed way of doing it, like just
    telling one of your friends that you are interested in going to the
    cinema, and ask them to ask someone else, and so on. You rely more
    one some kind of choreography, that each of your friends contributes
    to the process and drives it forward until you have a stable
    agreement.

The orchestration solution is probably the most controllable from your
point of view, since you keep overview of the entire process and you
have control over who has answered and so on, but it also requires you
to coordinate everything. On the other hand, the choreography solution
may end up in an argument like "Okay I thought we agreed on this movie
and now you want to watch Halloween anyway?" However, choreographies can
work quite nicely if everyone behaves as expected, and it does not
depend on you as an orchestrator in the middle.

The same kind of behavior is possible for systems that consist of
several components.

**Orchestration:** A centralized program (the orchestrator) takes care of coordinating all requests to other components. 
The orchestrator keeps control of all the other components and controls when to call them, and processes their results.

**Choreography:** There is a global coordination of components, following a decentralized approach. 
This usually requires that you need to have control over more than one component.

source: figures/iot/api-choreography.svg
caption: "In a choreography, the interaction emerges from the individual components, but there is no central manager."

When creating applications with several applications, you will have to decide which kind of coordination pattern you want to follow.
Sometimes, orchestration or choreographies are necessary or beneficial, sometimes a combination of the two may be most suitable.

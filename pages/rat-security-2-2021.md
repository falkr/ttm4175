## Question 1

:rat:Which of the following is not true for packet switched networks?

1. It was introduced with the old type of telephone networks
2. Long data is breaked into pieces while sending it over the network
3. The sender and the destination address must be in each packet
4. It is more efficient than circuit switched networks

## Question 2

:rat:Which of the following is not true about a Hop?

1. Icmp protocol and its applications such as ping follows the hop count when travelling in the network
2. The increase of the number of hops results in greater transmission delay
3. The number of hops can be arbitrary between two devices when sending data
4. One hop is frequently between two network devices

## Question 3

:rat:Which of the following is not true for TCP

1. The error correction is part of it
2. Faster then UDP
3. The packets are ordered
4. It is guaranteed that every packet is arrived

## Question 4

:rat:Which of the following is true for ICMP?

1. Used for troubleshooting
2. A 3 way handshake provides the connection between the hosts
3. Works well in circuit switched networks
4. Port numbers are used for different services

## Question 5

:rat:Which of the following is not true for UDP?

1. Used when speed is important
2. The data is reassembled at the destination
3. A packet sent later than another can be processed earlier
4. A 3 way handshake provides the connection between the hosts

## Question 6

:rat:In which situation would you use UDP?

1. large amount of data has to be sent and the security is important
2. small amount of data has to be sent and the security is not important
3. small amount of data has to be sent and the security is important
4. large amount of data has to be sent and the security is not important

## Question 7

:rat:In which situation would you use TCP?

1. When intact data has to be arrived
2. Video broadcast

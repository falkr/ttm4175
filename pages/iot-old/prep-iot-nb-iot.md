This week we are going to connect an IoT device (an Arduino) to the Internet via NB-IoT, a new communication standard that has been deployed very recently.

We'll have a guest lecturer from [Telenor's Start IoT Initiative.](https://startiot.telenor.com)

## NB-IoT

Here's a very short video on NB-IoT. Have a look:

## Installation of the Arduino IDE

The device we are going to program is an Arduino with an NB-IoT modem. Therefore, we need the Arduino IDE for programming. Please install the Arduino IDE on your laptop. [You find the Arduino IDE here.](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

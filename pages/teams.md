# Teams


In this course we will work in teams. To be flexible and have the optimal number of students for the different activities, we have a structure of double teams:

* You will be assigned to a team of three students, this is your **core team** __(kjerneteam)__.
* Two core teams are combined into a **double team** of six students, for tasks which are better in larger teams.

The team ID consists of a letter and a number that distinguish core team and double team. You will find the team assignments on Blackboard.

We will use the double teams for:

* activities during the lectures
* the team RATs

The smaller core teams of 3 we use for:

* the labs
* the reports

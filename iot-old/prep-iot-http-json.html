<h1>HTTP and JSON</h1>

<p>In this week, we will communicate via HTTP and build our own little
server for that. This server will be able to serve a simple website and
we will use it to store data from the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>You remember that we worked with something similar in the second week,
where we created a website on an Apache web server.
This time, we use the webserver to build a smart home system, and we also program it in Python instead of using Apache.</p>
<h2>Learning Goals</h2>

<p>Goals: After this week, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create your own webserver in Python.</li>
<li>Serialize data in Python via JSON.</li>
<li>Send complex data types via HTTP.</li>
<li>Assemble an overall system.</li>
<li>Know more about HTTP, JSON, client-server, request-response.</li>
</ul>

    </section>
    <section class="content">
<h1>Example: A Smart Home System</h1>
<p>Let's first look at an example system. Two weeks ago you learned how to
connect the Sense HAT and the Raspberry Pi to a Python program, so that
you could read values from the Sense HAT and also turn on its LEDs.
Imagine now that this Raspberry Pi is part of a system you want to
install at home, for instance to check the temperature while you are
away, and maybe switch on the heater before you arrive home. The sensors
report their values to a server. Since this server is somewhere in a
data center, we say that it's running <em>in the cloud.</em> The sensors report
their values periodically to the server, and the server keeps track of
the values sent. When we want to know the temperature at home, we can
simply ask the web server with a browser to present us the last measured
temperature value.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/iot/smart-home.png" alt="An example system with a temperature sensor that sends its measurements to a server. Users can check the temperature by accessing a website published by the server" width="100%"/>
<span name="figures/iot/smart-home.png">&nbsp;</span>
<aside name="figures/iot/smart-home.png"><p><p>An example system with a temperature sensor that sends its measurements to a server. Users can check the temperature by accessing a website published by the server</p>
</p></aside>
</div>
<p>During this week, we want to implement such a system, with the Raspberry
Pi and Sense HAT as our sensor, and another Raspberry Pi as the web
server. For this, we need several elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to know more about the WWW and the HTTP protocol.</li>
<li>We need to transform data so we can send it.</li>
<li>We need to build a web server in Python.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Think a bit:</strong> What can be some benefits of using HTTP, a web server
and a browser as elements in this system?</p>

    </section>
    <section class="content">
<h1>Sequence Diagrams and Message Patterns</h1>
<p>From today on we start to think a bit more about the patterns of
interactions between computers, that is, in which sequence they send
messages between each other. For that, we use a special type of diagram,
called <strong>sequence diagram</strong>. Below you see a very simple one. The
vertical lines (top to bottom) are called <em>lifelines</em> and define a
computer or any other communicating element. The box at the start of the
lifeline describes what the lifeline represents. Here, we just apply
role names, and call one of them <em>sender</em> and the other one <em>receiver</em>.
The horizontal arrow represents a message that travels between the
computers.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/iot/single-message.svg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>Messages can be lost, for instance when somebody plugs out a cable,
disturbs the wireless signal or when some part of the network in between
fails. We can show that a message is lost by letting it run into a big
cross:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/iot/single-message.svg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>The above interaction follows a simple patternthat we call <strong>single
message.</strong> As you can see, a problem with this message pattern is that
messages can get lost, and neither the sender nor the receiver detect
it. For that reason, we often use other message patterns or build
applications so that they can handle message losses. The next pattern we
are going to look at is already an improvement.</p>

<h2>The Request-Response Message Pattern</h2>
<p>Another message pattern is <strong>request-response</strong>, shown in the diagram
below. It is used when one computer (the <em>requestor</em>) wants to get some
information from another one (the <em>responder</em>).</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/iot/request-response.svg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>Another benefit of the request-response pattern is that the requestor
knows that the responder has received the request once it receives the
response. Therefore, we often use a request-response pattern even when
we are not interested in the content of the response, just to be sure
that the original request has ben sent. The response in this case is
also called <em>acknowledgement</em>, and the entire pattern is called a
<em>handshake</em>. In case the requestor does not receive a response within
some time, it can for instance try again and send another request. To
sum up, the request-response pattern is used in two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the requestor needs some data from the responder, i.e., when
the requestor wants to know something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the requestor only wants to tell something to the responder,
but wants to know of the responder actually received the data.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>WWW -- The World Wide Web</h1>

<p>Many people do not distinguish between the <em>Internet</em> and the <em>World
Wide Web</em>.[^1] The two are, however, quite different: The <em>Internet</em>, as
you have learned by now, is a system of interconnected computer networks
that communicate via IP and enable services like email, video streaming,
or internet telephony. It also enables the World Wide Web, which is a
collection of documents that you can access from specific servers.</p>

<h2>The Client-Server Model</h2>
<p>When you access a website, this involves an interaction between two
computers: The web server that stores the website, and your computer
with a web browser that acts as a client.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/iot/client-server.svg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>Both the client and the server are computers, but within this
interaction model they behave quite different: The server doesn't know
anything about the clients before they connect, and just waits for
clients. Once a client makes a request, it answers this request with a
response. The server <em>serves</em> the request. In the basic case of serving
a website, the server only reacts on the requests. All interactions are
initiated (started) by the client.</p>
<p>Often, servers are powerful machines, running in a data center and
serving many clients. But that is not always the case. A server can also
be a tiny computer, serving only a single or a few other clients. The
term <em>client-server</em> only refers to the roles they have in the
interactions: the client takes initiative and the server responds.</p>

<h2>HTTP</h2>
<p>Once two computers communicate, we have to ensure that they understand
each other. This is where protocols come in. They define a set of rules
that all partners have to follow. You already know something about the
<em>Internet Protocol</em>, IP. This protocol defines how we can send data
packages between computers connected networks that together make up the
Internet. TCP is a protocol that is used to control IP packets, so that
they arrive in a particular order and are resubmitted when they get
lost.[^2]</p>
<p>Sending data packets does not yet ensure that computers can actually
understand the data. This is why there are protocols defined on top of
TCP and IP, for the different types of applications that we want to use
on the internet. For accessing websites, this protocol is HTTP, or
<em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em>. HTTP is based on a pattern that is called
request-response, meaning that all interactions consist of a request
message, sent by the client, and a corresponding response, sent by the
server. To get a website, the request looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the keyword <code>GET</code> shows that the browser would like to access
a resource. It is followed by <code>/index.html</code>, which is the path of the
website we would like to read. The corresponding response can look like
this:[^3]</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 23 May 2005 22:38:34 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 138
Last-Modified: Wed, 08 Jan 2003 23:11:55 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.3.7 (Unix) (Red-Hat/Linux)
ETag: &quot;3f80f-1b6-3e1cb03b&quot;
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Connection: close

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;An Example Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  Hello World, this is a very simple HTML document.
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The answer indicates the HTTP version, followed by the token <code>200 OK</code>,
which means that the response actually contains the requested
information. When a site is not accessible, the code is a
<code>404 Not Found</code>, which you may have seen when browsing the web.
Following the header information is the actual content of the document
we want to access. Here, it is a HTML site, beginning with the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
tag. This language describes websites with some markup, so that you can
have tables and arrange all sorts of elements and render them in a
browser. So when you request a website, it's basically these two
messages that are exchanged between your browser (the client) and the
web server.</p>

<h1>Web Server in Python</h1>
<p>It's simple to create a web server in Python.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/iot/python-server.svg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>Of course, much of the code running the server is hidden in libraries,
but our code controls some interesting parts of the server.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We define a class <code>RequestHandler</code>. This class has the only task to
define how we answer a request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a request comes to the web server, the method <code>do_GET(self)</code> is
called by the server. In this method we can compute our response. In
this case, we return response code <code>200</code> (which means OK), set the
content type in the header, and then set the content to be
<code>Hello World</code>. We encode the string into bytes, using Unicode
<code>utf-8</code> encoding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These lines start the actual server. We create an instance of the
class <code>HTTPServer</code> and then tell it to start.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Don't worry too much about some of the code here, but focus on the
<code>do_GET()</code> method, which gets called once the request arrives and then
computes an answer.</p>

<h1>Serialization of Data</h1>
<p>When two computers communicate, they send their data as a sequence of
bits or bytes, which in turn are transformed into electrical or optical
signals that then travel via cables or fibers. But how do we get such a
sequence of bits from the data? Somehow we must ensure that data that is
translated into a sequence of bits also can be translated back again
once we receive them. For this, we need serialization methods.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/iot/serialization.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>If we just want to transfer text, there is for instance the ASCII
standard that explains how letters, numbers and other signs are
transformed into bits. A text (or <em>string</em>) is a sequence of characters,
An <code>A</code>, for instance, is represented by the bits <code>100 0001</code>. The Unicode
standard expands ASCII to convert a much larger set of symbols,
including <code>Ê</code>, <code>¯</code>, and <code>Â</code>. Unicode also encodes emoji. To transfer
text or emoji, we must hence know ho they are encoded (for instance
which specific version of Unicode) and look up the bits and bytes in a
table. (We <em>serialized</em> the data.) The other way round, when we receive
bits and want to create letters from it, we <em>deserialize</em> the data,
which means that we look up which letters the bits correspond to.</p>
<p>Serialization is not only useful when we want to transmit data from one
computer to another. It is also useful when we want to store a data
structure into a file. A file is storing a series of bytes, and
serialization determines how we get these bytes from a data structure.</p>
<p>Now imagine we want to transfer more structured data, for instance the
measurements of a sensor in a house. We would like to send the current
time, the temperature and the humidity. To do that, we could of course
send a string that just lists the different data items in a sequence,
for instance:</p>
<pre><code>12:05  20.0  54.3
</code></pre>
<p>When we then deserialize the data, i.e., construct the measurement
values at the receiver side, we need to know in which sequence these
values were and put everything correct back together. For a simple
problem, this is possible, but you can imagine how many mistakes may
happen here!</p>

<h2>Serialization With JSON</h2>
<p>Instead of inventing our method of putting data into a data sequence
each time, we use a more robust and standardized way of packing the data
together. Have a look at the following:</p>
<pre><code>{&quot;time&quot;: &quot;12:05&quot;, &quot;temperature&quot;: 20.0, &quot;humidity&quot;: 54.3}
</code></pre>
<p>This way of writing data is called JSON, pronounced &quot;Jason,&quot; and an
abbreviation for <em>JavaScript Object Notation</em>, because it was originally
inspired by how JavaScript serialized its objects. It may also remind
you of a Python dictionary. The example above is only a very simple one.
The data can also be nested, i.e., a data field can refer to a JSON
structure that for instance declares the data fields separate from each
other or adds the information in which unit the measurement is given,
for instance as follows:</p>
<pre><code>{&quot;time&quot;: {&quot;hour&quot;:12, 
          &quot;minutes&quot;: 5,
          &quot;seconds&quot;: 0}, 
 &quot;temperature&quot;: {&quot;value&quot;: 20.0, 
                 &quot;unit&quot;: &quot;celcius&quot;}, 
 &quot;humidity&quot;: {&quot;value&quot;: 54.3, 
              &quot;unit&quot;: &quot;percent&quot;}}
</code></pre>
<p>There's a lot of history in such data formats, and sometimes it's not
even technical reasons why one is used or the other, or how they look in
detail. Another format used for similar purposes is called <code>XML</code>, or
<em>Extensible Markup Language</em>. In this language, the same piece of data
could look as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;dataset&gt;
    &lt;data name=&quot;time&quot; value=&quot;12:05&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;data name=&quot;temperature&quot; value=&quot;20.0&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;data name=&quot;humidity&quot; value=&quot;54.3&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/dataset&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>XML looks a lot more like the HTML that is used to encode a website.
Since JSON is a bit simpler to use, we will stick with it in the
following.</p>
<h2>JSON in Python</h2>
<p>For Python there is a library to convert data structures into JSON and
back again. This is how you import the library:</p>

<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">import</span> json</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We assume that the data structure is stored as a Python dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>measurement = {'time': '12:05', 'temperature': 20.0, 'humidity': 54.3}
</code></pre>
<p>There is an operation <code>json.dumps()</code> to create the JSON-serialized
string out of a data structure.</p>
<pre><code>string = json.dumps(measurement)
print(string)
</code></pre>
<p>The output will be the following:</p>
<pre><code>{&quot;time&quot;: &quot;12:05&quot;, &quot;humidity&quot;: 54.3, &quot;temperature&quot;: 20.0}
</code></pre>
<p>The resulting string in JSON almost looks like the original Python
string. This is because Python dictionaries look very similar to JSON,
but this also works for more complex data types.</p>
<p>The other way round will also work; The function <code>json.loads()</code> takes a
JSON string and creates a Python data type from it. For instance, we can
do the following:</p>
<pre><code>measurement = json.loads('{&quot;time&quot;: &quot;12:05&quot;, &quot;humidity&quot;: 54.3, &quot;temperature&quot;: 20.0}')
</code></pre>
<p>The result is that the variable <code>measurement</code> now has data of type
<code>dict</code>. Now we can work on the data like with any other Python data
type, and integrate it in our application.</p>
<p>So, simplified said, with JSON we can convert any Python data type into
a string that follows the JSON specification. It is then easy to store
or transmit this string (as a series of bytes), and transform it back
into data again.</p>

<h1 id="state-machines">State Machines</h1>
<p>So far, you have learned how to use Python to program a device. You may remember that we were using a simple application pattern, in which we had a main while-loop. For simple applications, this is sufficient and works well. But this way of programming can quickly get very complicated, if you want to build more complex applications and solve a bit more difficult issues.</p>
<p>This week we will learn a way to express more complicated behavior using the concept of state machines. This is a concept that you will meet again in other courses, because state machines are a useful tool to describe behavior, and especially behavior where several things are going on at the same time. Communication protocols can be described and built with state machines, and systems can express how they synchronize their behavior using state machines.</p>
<p>For IoT, state machines can be useful to describe how a device controls its behavior, and we will use it to create some more complex examples.</p>
<h2 id="learning-goals">Learning Goals</h2>

<div class="goals"><p>After this week, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create and understand simple state machines.</li>
<li>Program a transition method in Python.</li>
<li>Find some design flaws in simple state machines.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="hello-state-machines">Hello, State Machines!</h2>

<p>Let’s assume we need to describe how a traffic light works. One idea is to just take pictures of a traffic light, like this:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/statemachines/traffic-light-1.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>That already helps — the photos describe the phases in which we can observe the traffic light. Whenever we look at the traffic light, it is in one of the phases described by the photos. For easier reference we have even given these photos some labels, intuitively <em>red</em>, <em>red-yellow</em>, <em>green</em> and <em>yellow</em>. (The <em>red-yellow</em> is common in many, but not all countries.)</p>

<p>The photos already help explaining the traffic light. But imagine you want to explain on paper in which sequence a traffic light switches its lights. One way is text, but a simpler way is to add arrows between the photos, like this:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/statemachines/traffic-light-2.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>Of course, the picture above is a simplification. Some trafic lights are switched off at night and just blink yellow. The same happens as a default state in case there is an error in the controller. We can show this blinking with the two additional photos <em>blink-off</em> and <em>blink-on</em>. The two arrows between them show how the blinking is created by two phases, one with the yellow light on and one with all lights off. We also show that blinking can be started from any of the other phases, because an error can always happen, and the lights may be switched off at any time. When we get out of the blinking sequence, we go towards the phase <em>red</em> for safety.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/statemachines/traffic-light-3.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>That’s a complete and detailed description of a traffic light. As one last thing we add an arrow to mark in which phase a traffic light starts once it is switched on for the first time. For safety, we put it into <em>red</em> first.</p>

    </section>
    <section class="content">
<h1 id="state-machine-diagrams">State Machine Diagrams</h1>

<p>For the traffic light above we described actually a state machine. Since taking photos of real objects is cumbersome, and we also want to describe abstract things we cannot take a photo off, we replace the photos above with a more convenient symbol, a rectangle with rounded corners. These are the states in which the traffic light can be. A state machine for the traffic light looks then like this:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/statemachines/traffic-light-4.svg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>Notice the detailed elements in this diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>The states are shown as rounded rectangles. The state names are shown in bold text. As a naming convention, we only use lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores for state machine names, similar to rules for variable names in programming languages.</li>
<li>The start of the state machine is shown by a compact black dot. This is also a state, called the <em>initial state</em>. Once the state machine is activated, it starts at this initial state.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="states">States</h2>
<p>State symbols with the same name refer to the same state. This means, we can use a copy of the state symbol to make our layout easier, without changing what we actually mean by the diagram. For instance, we can remove the long arrow from state <code>yellow</code> to state <code>red</code> just by having another copy of the symbol for state <code>red</code>:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/statemachines/traffic-light-5.svg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>The diagram describes exactly the same behavior. Both state symbols for the state <code>red</code> refer to the same state, so our traffic light still has the same number of states, just its layout changed. In this simple state machine this doesn’t really matter, but this can help you to create better layouts once state machines become larger.</p>

<p><strong>State Names:</strong> Selecting good names for states can help making state machine easier to understand, especially when the states map to phases of the thing we want to model, like <em>on</em> and <em>off</em> for a lamp, or <em>open</em> and <em>close</em> for a lock. But sometimes there is no obvious good name. In such cases, I recommend to use state names like <code>s0</code>, <code>s1</code>. You always have the possibility to attach a note to a state and explain what it means.</p>

<h2 id="transitions">Transitions</h2>
<p>The arrows between the states are called <strong>transitions</strong>. We have said above that the state machine is at any point in time in exactly one of its states. It is not in two or more of them at the same time, and it is never somewhere in between. Conceptually, this means that a state machine switches from one state to another <strong>within no time at all</strong>, meaning that <strong>transitions take no time</strong>. This sounds magical, but we will come back to this.</p>
<p>So far, we have not yet talked about <em>when</em> a transition happens, this means, what <strong>triggers</strong> a transition. We have, for example, not described <em>when</em> the traffic light switches from <code>red</code> to <code>red_yellow</code>. There are three types of events that can trigger transitions in a state machine:</p>
<ul>
<li>The state machine is started, then its <strong>transition from the initial state</strong> is triggered. This happens when the component or code surrounding the machine is started and then starts up the machine, for instance when we boot our firmware and the software starts running.</li>
<li>The state machine observes the <strong>expiration of a timer</strong>. Timers are managed by the machine itself, and we will learn how timers can be started and stopped later.</li>
<li>When we work with the Microbit, the events can be <strong>actions from the user</strong>, like pressing any of the buttons, or that device detects a gesture.</li>
</ul>
<p>A transition must have exactly one trigger. Without one, it would never be started at all. For simplicity, we also don’t allow more than one trigger. A trigger is declared using a label on the arrow, followed by a <code>/</code>. This means that you should have a trigger label at all transitions.</p>
<p>The only exception to this rule are transitions starting at initial states, because their trigger is implicitly the start of the entire machine.</p>

<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
<p>Let’s have a look at a blinking light that you find often at the entry of tunnels. The light blinks with two lamps to indicate that the tunnel is closed. The blinking happens so that either the left lamp or the right lamp are on, and they switch every second.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/statemachines/tunnel.jpg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>From our experience with the more complex traffic light, this should be an easy state machine to write down. It has two states, <code>left</code>and <code>right</code>, corresponding to one of the lamps being switched on. We also added labels to some of the transitions. They describe that the state machine switches from state <code>left</code> to state <code>right</code> triggered by an event <code>t1</code>. This is a timer. It switches back with a timer <code>t2</code>. The detailed timer operations are not yet visible, we come later to that.</p>
<p>In this blinking light we also show how to switch it off. This happens by an event called <code>off</code>, and it can happen in any of the two states. If it happens, we switch into a final state, which is shown as a circle with an extra frame.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/statemachines/tunnel-1.svg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>Now we also want to specify the actions to switch the individual lamps on and off. We assume that we have for this the actions <code>left_on()</code>, <code>left_off()</code>, and <code>right_on()</code>, <code>right_off()</code>. We already use Python syntax for these actions. In our state machine diagram we can use these actions and add them to the transitions.</p>
<p>The actions are also called an <strong>effect</strong> of the transition, and happen at the same instant the transition is executed, that means, when we switch states. The effects are written behind the <code>/</code> of the transition label.</p>
<ul>
<li>The state machine runs action <code>left_on()</code> when it starts, as declared by the initial transition.</li>
<li>When the machine switches from state <code>left</code> to <code>right</code>, it runs actions <code>left_off()</code> and <code>right_on()</code>, separated with a <code>;</code>.</li>
<li>When the machine switches from state <code>right</code> to <code>left</code>, it runs actions <code>right_off()</code> and <code>left_on()</code>, separated with a <code>;</code>.</li>
<li>When the blinking light switches off and moves into the final state, we run actions <code>left_off()</code> or <code>right_off()</code>, depending on in which of the two states we are.</li>
</ul>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/statemachines/tunnel-2.svg" width="100%"/>
</div>
<h2 id="timers">Timers</h2>
<p>The expiration of a timer can trigger a transition. By convention, we name timers with a prefix <code>t</code>, like for example <code>t0</code>. To declare that a transition is triggered by a timer, we simply write the name of the timer in the beginning of the transition label.</p>
<p>State machines manage timers on their own, wich also means that timers can only be started as part of an action within the same state machine. As we anticipate already our implementation in Python, we use the following syntax for controlling timers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>start_timer(t1, 1000)</code> starts a timer with name <code>t1</code> that will expire after 1000 milliseconds. If we invoke this action again while the timer is active and has not yet expired yet, the countdown will again start from the beginning, i.e., we expect the timeout 1000 milliseconds from the last call of <code>start_timer(t1, 1000)</code>.</li>
<li><code>stop_timer(t1)</code> stops a timer, so that a timeout will not happen in the future. In case this action is called but <code>t1</code> already expired or was never started before, nothing happens.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<h3 id="spaghetti-timer-example">Spaghetti Timer Example</h3>
<p>Imagine we want to describe the behavior of a simple spaghetti timer. This timer expires after 10 minutes and then beeps for 3 seconds. We can do this with the state machine below.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/statemachines/spaghetti-1.svg" alt="Simple timer that beeps for 3 seconds after 10 minutes are over." width="100%"/>

</p></aside>
</div>
<h2 id="decisions">Decisions</h2>
<p>In some cases, we want to have a choice in which state a transition should switch, based on conditions in data. As an example, let’s look at the incomplete state machine below. It describes a part of a controller for a heater. In state <code>heater_on</code> we wait for 1 second for timer <code>t</code>, which triggers the transition towards the choice state. This choice state has two alternative branches, distinguished by two guards, in rectangular brackets. Think of them as an if-statement in a programming language. (And that is actually how we will later implement them.) If the temperature is okay, we switch into state <code>heater_off</code>. If not, we take the else-branch and restart the timer, to check again in another 1000 milliseconds.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/statemachines/choice.svg" alt="Part of a temperature controller, using a decision with branches." width="100%"/>
<span name="figures/statemachines/choice.svg">&nbsp;</span>
<aside name="figures/statemachines/choice.svg"><p><p>Part of a temperature controller, using a decision with branches.</p>
</p></aside>
</div>
<p>Don’t worry too much about what to write into the guard for now. This will get clearer once we implement state machines in Python.</p>
<p>A decision can have many outgoing branches. One of them must have a guard that is true, otherwise the state machine would be blocked. I therefore recommend to have an else-branch, which is true whenever none of the other branches is true.</p>

<h2 id="transitions-revisited">Transitions, Revisited</h2>
<p>Now you have seen many kinds of transitions, and we can summarize all the different terms for them. Knowing these terms makes talking about state machines much easier when you design one together with other engineers. So we have the following transitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>initial transition</strong> originates at an initial state. It does not declare a trigger, since it is executed immediately when the state machine starts.</li>
<li>A <strong>self-transition</strong> is simply a transition that starts and ends in the same state.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transition-labels">Transition Labels</h3>
<p>We have seen now all the types of elements that we can add into the label of a transition. This summarizes information from above, and you can read it as a repetition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guards:</strong> Transitions originating in a choice state must have them.</li>
<li><strong>Triggers:</strong> All transitions originating in a normal state must declare a trigger, which is either the reception of a message or the expiration of a timer. Pseudostates like initial states or choice states are transient, and the outgoing transitions therefore do not declare a trigger.</li>
<li><strong>Effects:</strong> Any transition can declare any number of action that it executes. Several actions are separated by a semicolon.</li>
<li><strong>Slash (/):</strong> The slash separates triggers from actions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="states-revisited">States, Revisited</h2>
<p>Let’s also have a look at all the different states we have seen until now, and repeat some properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial states and choice states are called <strong>pseudo states</strong>, because they are not really states in the sense that we wait in them. They are transient states, meaning that the state machine is only going through them, but never waits in them. For that reason, transition originating at initial or choice states do not declare a trigger.</li>
<li>At any time, a state machine is in exactly one of its states. We assume that transitions execute in no time, so we never find a state machine like “waiting” within a transition. Waiting only happens within states.</li>
<li>State symbols with the same name refer to the same state.</li>
<li>State symbols are a compact rounded rectangle, and optionally contain a compartment where we can declare entry actions, exit actions and internal transitions.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="errors-in-state-machines">Errors in State Machines</h1>

<p>You may think: <em>“Why do we need all these rules for state machines?”</em> This is because we want to describe behavior precisely, in such a way that it is unambiguous (everyone knows what it means) and so that it does not contain any errors, or at least that errors would be easy to find.</p>
<p>In the following we are going to describe some examples of state machines that contain an error or that are somehow problematic, in the sense that they show behavior that is probably not intended or useful for an application.</p>

<h3 id="missing-initial-states">Missing Initial States</h3>
<p>When the initial state is missing, we don’t know where to start the state machine. So every state machine must have exactly one initial state.</p>

<div class="figure">

<aside name="figures/statemachines/error-1.svg"><p><p>Missing initial states.</p>
</p></aside>
</div>
<h3 id="missing-triggers">Missing Triggers</h3>
<p>Every transition out of an ordinary state needs a trigger, otherwise there is no way it will ever be executed. Only the initial transition has no trigger attached, because it is implicitly triggered by the start of the machine.</p>

<p>Look at the example below: Imagine we are in state <code>s1</code> and event <code>e1</code> happens. In this state machine it is not clear if we are moving into state <code>s2</code> or <code>s3</code>, since both transitions are labeled with the same event.</p>

<h3 id="timer-is-never-started">Timer is Never Started</h3>
<p>Another example is that we wait for an even that never happens, like in the example below. A timer can only ever expire if we started it before. In the state machine, the timer <code>t1</code> will never expired because it never gets started in the first place. This is almost certainly an error, because if we never want the timer to expire, we shouldn’t even declare such a transiton. So probably, the creator of the machine forgot to start the timer.</p>

<h1 id="state-machines-in-micro-python">State Machines in Micro Python</h1>
<p>The Microbit we are going to program does not run all Python code, but a reduced set of it that is called MicroPython. To run state machines on it, we will provide you with some code that serves as a template or a skeletton.</p>
<p>The state machines were so far expressed as diagrams, that is visual pictures.</p>
<p>We create the state machines by manually translating a diagram step for step into a Python function that executes transitions.</p>

<p>The method receives 4 parameters;</p>
<ul>
<li><code>self</code></li>
<li><code>state</code></li>
<li><code>event</code></li>
<li><code>timers</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Within the method, we place first an if-statement which distinguishes the different states of the machine. It has one branch for each state.</p>
<p>Within each state branch, ther is another, if-statement, which distinguishes the different events.</p>
<p>Within these branches, we then do actions;</p>
<ul>
<li>start a timer</li>
<li>stop a timer</li>
<li>call a function to do something in the microbit, like switching on an LED</li>
<li>change a variable (use self)</li>
</ul>
